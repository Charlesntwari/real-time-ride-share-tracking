# real-time-ride-share-tracking
This project is a simple web application that demonstrates real-time ride-share tracking using the Google Maps API. The app displays a route from Nyabugogo to Kimironko in Kigali with five intermediate stops. The driver's current location is displayed with real-time tracking, and the ETA to the next stop is calculated and displayed.
